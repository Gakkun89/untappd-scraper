IPA is our go-to style here at BrewDog; from Punk to Hardcore, Jack Hammer to Atlantic IPA, we have majored in bringing you as many hop-forward beers to you as is humanly possible.\n\nWe wanted to brew a completely new and conceptual IPA that paid tribute to the style’s origins whilst incorporating the devastatingly modern techniques and technologies. A 21st Century drink with an 18th Century ethos; a very new yet very old IPA.\n\nWe found our inspiration from a doctor. The ‘father of Pharmacology’ Dr Jonathan Pereira to be precise. In 1843 he published a book which shook the establishment. Titled ‘A Treatise on Food and Diet’.\n\nScrew any semblance of balance. This beer is like injecting hops straight into your tongue with a needle. Inspired by that other great era for India Pale Ales, the mid-nineteenth Century, Restorative Beverage is going to be impossible to remonstrate with, or counter. Its entire foundation exists on the basis of scientific fact.\n\nThe good Doctor had spoken. Restorative Beverage for Invalids and Convalescents is medical opinion writ large. History brought to life. It is the biggest, baddest, most uplifting IPA we have ever made. ",

An enlightenment classic, it was revered the world over.\n\nIn the post war era, monolithic corporate brewers drove the flavour and soul from this beer as they dumbed it down beyond recognition. Rice, corn and other substitutes were combined with huge corner cutting in the brewing process.\n\nThis bastardisation of a classic style now accounts for a staggering majority of total beer sales globally. Bland, artificial, fake. Good men, blissful in their ignorance, soak it up like vermin.\n\nWe want to restore the style to it’s former glory. Forget watery fizz. Forget translucent yellow. Forget transparent bottles. Forget added ingredients. Forget preservatives.\n\nFAKE Lager is everything a real lager should be. A craft brewed 100% malt beer with plenty of noble hops to play off the firm malt base. We make our lager the way we make our beer. The same crafted excellence. The same anarchic attitude. The same four ingredients (and when we say four, we damn well mean it).\n\nTo mark the launch and as a signal of intent we are holding a national crap beer amnesty this Saturday (6th April 2013) between noon and 5pm in all BrewDog bars. \n\nSimply hand over a can, bottle or even keg of lowest common denominator beer and we will give you a free half pint of FAKE lager in return.\n\nSay goodbye to fake lagers and hello to FAKE Lager.\n\nWe will then dispose of all the generic beers with some Chinese fireworks we bought online.

The peppery spice and toasted oak ingrained within these incredible barrels has imbued our imperial stout with a stunning depth of both aroma and flavour.
